    """Immutable state of a game.

    Includes board state, previous moves, captured pieces, possible
    moves, and end game state.

    Constructors:
        GameState.new(*, white, black)
            Initializes the first GameState of a game.
        GameState.from_fen(fen, *, white, black)
            Initializes a GameState from a FEN string, using the given
            players.

    Properties:
        id (int): The game state id.

        white (Player): The white player.
        black (Player): The black player.

        prev (Optional[GameState]): The previous GameState, or None if
            this is the first state.
        move (Optional[PieceMoved]): The move from the previous
            GameState, or None if this is the first state.

        end_game_state (Optional[EndGameState]): The end game state.

        current_color (Color): The color of the current player.
        current_player (Player): The current player.

        half_move_clock (int): The number of half-moves since the last
            capture or the last pawn moved.
        num_moves (int): The number of full moves played in the entire
            game.

    Methods:
        fen() -> str
            Returns the FEN representation of the game.
        board_to_str(empty=" .") -> str
            Returns a string representation of the board.
        moves_to_str(columns=4, captured_empty=True) -> str
            Returns a string representation of the moves for each piece.
        debug()
            Prints debug information about this game state.

        is_game_over() -> bool
            Returns whether the game is over (checkmate, stalemate, or
            draw).
        is_in_checkmate() -> bool
            Returns whether the current player is in checkmate.
        winner() -> Optional[Color]
            Returns the winner of the game (for checkmate).
        is_in_stalemate() -> bool
            Returns whether the current player is in stalemate.
        is_draw() -> bool
            Returns whether the game is a draw.

        is_in_check() -> bool
            Returns whether the current player is in check.
        needs_promotion() -> bool
            Returns whether the state is waiting for a promotion for the
            last moved pawn.
        promote(promote_type) -> GameState
            Promotes the promoting pawn.

        yield_all_pieces() -> Iterator[Piece]
            Yields all the pieces.
        yield_player_pieces() -> Iterator[Piece]
            Yields all the pieces for the current player.
        yield_player_moves() -> Iterator[PieceMove]
            Yields all the possible moves for the current player.
        num_captured() -> int
            Returns the number of captured pieces.
        yield_captured() -> Iterator[Piece]
            Yields the captured pieces.

        get_piece(bn, r, c) -> Optional[Piece]
            Gets the piece at the given position.

        make_move(move) -> GameState
            Makes the given move.
        step() -> GameState
            Advances a step of the game.
        run() -> GameState
            Runs the game until it's over.

        restart() -> GameState
            Returns the starting state with the same players.
